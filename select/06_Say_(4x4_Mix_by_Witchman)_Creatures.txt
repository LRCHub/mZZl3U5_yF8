I heard the news today
Billy's gone away
Left us all for good
No one understood

You only had to say
I would understand
You only had to say
Whatever come, what may

I was feeling low
You called and you were too
We'd meet Saturday
It happened on Wednesday

You only had to say it's sad
I would understand
I don't want you brave
A truce we made today

If you're feeling sad
On me you can depend
You only have to say
