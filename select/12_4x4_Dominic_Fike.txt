A million miles to a cemetery
A flower across your chest
A tear on a smile as you pray to a sky
But it won't bring back your breath
You know it isn't the love that you wish for
That you were misinformed as a child
'Cause everything in those beautiful stories
Was only a part of the lie
That told you every tongue that you kissed was a royal
And you know that your godmother flies
And it all seems so important
'Til you're drifting off at night
And the weight of your eyes and your face when you cry
Make the days you were young seem ages ago
If you could stay, would you go?
If you could stay, would you go?
Four by four
You build your own life story
Build your own life story
Build your own
A million miles and a year went by
And you still can't find your breath
Your tears went dry as you pray to a god
But he won't bring back the dead
And it was never a love that you wished for
Even when you were just a child
'Cause you knew everything in the stories
Were only a part of a lie
And the weight of your eyes and your face when you cry
Make the days you were young seem ages ago
If you could stay, we should go
If you could stay, we should go
Four by four
You build your own life story
Build your own life story
Build your own
Four by four
You build your own life story
Build your own life story
Build your own
