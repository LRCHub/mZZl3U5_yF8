if i were you id pack my bags and get the fuck out of dodge. i hope you enjoy your fifteen minutes of fame, because this is going to be fifteen minutes youre going to want to forget. faking your way through life on the back of someone else. if everyone jumped off a bridge i bet you would say it was your idea. i pray your broken family heals your broken neck, eat shit and live. you dug your own grave; i just helped you fill it in.
